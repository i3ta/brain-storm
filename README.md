## Installation

### Setup environment

To get local programs set up, you have to run from inside the `src/` folder:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all dependencies, as well as set up the local package in edit
mode so you can edit code and import it in whatever scripts you want to run.

> Note: This package is named `daikon` for no reason at all -- I just decided
> that was a good name for it.
